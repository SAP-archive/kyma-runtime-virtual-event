# Virtual Event - SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma runtime

## Description

This repository contains the material for the virtual event on SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma runtime. For this Kyma virtual event as part of Devtoberfest we appreciate you opening issues in this repository to deliver feedback and request support from us, so we can constantly improve the learning content for you.

**Imagine...**
You're a developer who is new to web development and clusterization. You've heard about a piece of Open Source software which is used by a variety of companies and independent developers to manage and extend existing and new software solutions on a Kubernetes Cluster. You're boss wants you to look into the topic and understand how this fresh piece of technology works and how the company and it's customers can benefit from building on top of it. The goal for you is to build a web application, use serverless functions and additional services to prepare your application for scale.

Prerequisites and recommendations for this virtual event are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Virtual event overview

This SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma runtime virtual event brings together, over a series of 6 exercises, a number of Kyma topics, centered around the Kyma open source runtime. You will install a local Kyma runtime on Kubernetes Minikube, then you will deploy and application and expose it over an Oauth2 secured API. Using the possibility to write extensions on Kyma will teach you how to interconnect different services and applications with each other. After you've set up and deployed your environment, applications and other needed pieces you will learn how to make it scallable for rapid user increase. Through this virtual event you will get in touch with a lot of different technologies like Node.js, Kubernetes, Kyma, Docker and more. No worries the example you're going to implement in this self-paced virtual event are written and documented in a way that, even if you're a beginner, you will understand what is happening.

### Material organization

The material constists of a series of exercises that are to be done in order (each one building on the previous one). Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the virtual event you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discusses with the entire class, led by the instructors, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

ðŸ‘‰ Where there's an action for you to perform, it will be prefixed with this pointing symbol, to help you focus on where you are in each exercise.

> As we don't have a public trial for SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma runtime runtime this course is build on the open source technologie also originally developed by SAP. With that we allow all of the attendees to go through the exercises.
