# Prerequisites

There are hardware and software prerequisites for participating in this Virtual Event.

## Hardware

Each participant must have their own laptop with enough admin privileges to be able to install software. You must also be able to access a command line shell (e.g. `cmd.exe` on Windows). The laptop must also be able to connect to the Internet.
Your own machine needs to fullfil the hardware requirements described on the official [Kyma Project](https://kyma-project.io/docs/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-locally).

## Software

Before the Virtual Event, participants must ensure they have the following installed on their laptops:

- Docker Desktop : [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (once installed, test out the installation by following the instructions [here for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [here for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), ensuring that you can run the `docker` command line tool)

## Services

Each attendee must have the following already set up and enabled:

- an SAP Cloud Platform trial account. If you need to create a new account, go to [https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com), select the "Register" button and follow the instructions.

- within your SAP Cloud Platform trial account, the Cloud Foundry trial should be set up, with an organization and space ready to work in (if you follow the setup instructions on a new trial account, you'll be led through this process automatically).
