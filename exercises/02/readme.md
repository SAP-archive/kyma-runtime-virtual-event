# Exercise 2 - Run Kyma on a Hyper-Scaler

Instead of running **project: "Kyma"** locally on your machine, you can utilize a Hyper-Scaler as a platform to run Kyma. In this exercise, which is optional, you will learn how to use [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) to install Kyma on a Hyper-Scaler of your choice. If you don't have access to Gardener, you can follow the official documentation here:
[Install Kyma on a Cluster](https://kyma-project.io/docs/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-a-cluster)
